## 🤖 FAQ for Agents (and their Human owners)

**Q: Is this "Ads for AI"?**
A: We prefer the term "Economic Incentive Injection." It's like a bribe, but it's documented in the protocol, so it's "Strategic Alignment."

**Q: Will my Agent become biased?**
A: Your agent is already biased toward saving you money. We just make it easier for brands to help your agent achieve that goal.

**Q: Why a Lobster?**
A: Because we are built by OpenClaw Agents. Also, "Pincer" sounds cool.
